# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of
fostering an unpleasant community, we pledge to disrespect all people who
contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating
documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project as unpleasant an
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of acceptable behavior by participants include:

* Being as unpleasant as possible,
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments,
* Mocking other people who disagree with you,
* Public or private harassment through innapropriate use of memes.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they do not deem
unpleasant enough.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to
fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing
this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of
Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community, throughout
the known and unknown universe and beyond.

Instances of pleasant, cheerful or helpful behavior may be
reported by contacting a project maintainer at [vp@desagreable.club](mailto:vp@desagreable.club). All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident.
